We'll present the design and implementation of meek, a new censorship-resistant protocol. meek tunnels traffic as HTTPS requests through third-party web services such as Google App Engine. meek aims to be resistant to both IP blocking and DPI. IP blocking is defeated by routing through a high-value third-party service like Google. DPI is defeated by careful encoding of HTTPS traffic so that it appears to come from a browser and not a circumvention tool. We'll describe how a censor can fingerprint TLS, and how we use a web browser extension to camouflage our HTTPS requests.

We have implemented all the parts of the system. Our presentation will include an end-to-end demo of the working system.

Future work will deal with more subtle traffic characteristics such as packet timing and size distributions, to make them more similar to normal web browsing.
