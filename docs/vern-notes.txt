Points to clarify/enhance:

x The abstract does not effectively convey the nature of the approach
  It needs to spell out the tunneled and fate-sharing nature of the
  system more clearly.  For example, "proxied through a web service that
  may itself be blocked by the censor" sounds like it can't possibly work.

x meek essentially uses something akin to double-tunneling.  You could
  make this more clear.

x In general, meek doesn't need to be tied to Tor, or in fact to any
  sort of confidentiality/privacy-preserving backend.  I think you should
  acknowledge this up front.  There's a quite reasonable tradeoff for users
  to consider here: if their threat model is only regarding evading the
  censor, then they might prefer the significantly better performance of
  being able to directly web surf (say) rather than building Tor circuits
  and the like.  While you might disagree with that choice, you should
  consider the degree to which providing less-than-great security sometimes
  hugely enables deployment of a system (such as SSH's leap-of-faith "PKI"
  approach).

* Related to this, you should assess how much performance overhead your
  approach imposes.

x Figure 1 should come much earlier, basically in the Introduction.
  Otherwise, it's hard to follow just where the paper is going.  In
  particular, the current narrative structure in the intro doesn't work
  well.  Even though I came in already knowing how the scheme works,
  I found the discussion confusing.

x In the Intro, when mentioning Section 6, foreshadow the general
  strategy you'll take for addressing the additional considerations.

* "indistinguishable from a uniformly random byte stream" - note,
  that means it actually *does* look like something (i.e., like a
  random byte stream), so this only achieves the goal if observing
  such byte streams is not peculiar in network traffic.

x The discussion of CensorSpoofer on page 5 seems out of place, and in
  particular the paragraph after it appears to naturally follow the
  one just before it.

x Tell us what issues arise in using CensorSpoofer.

x The discussion of GoAgent is hard to follow.  It would help
  significantly to have an illustrative diagram.  (Perhaps you
  can use your architecture diagram plus some enhancements.)

* In the beginning of section 5, it would be reasonable to state that
  blocking Google would cause *major* collateral damage.  (It's not uncommon
  for blocking to potentially cause *some* collateral damage, but usually
  not to a degree that worries the censor.)

x "There are many parts of the TLS handshake, but the two that most
  distinguish ..." - if there are many parts then it behooves you to
  analyze *all* of them lest one of the less obvious ones also leaks
  information.

x Briefly explain what TLS session tickets are.

* Figure 4 would work better as  histogram.  In addition, you could
  plot both distributions on the same plot to enable more direct
  comparison.  (Explain TBB = Tor Browser Bundle.)

* Tell us what LBL is.

* The mention of Google's TXT DNS records is baffling because it's
  so terse.

* Consider assessing in the LBL trace each user's aggregate traffic
  to Google (# connections, # bytes).  The worry would be that that
  sort of summary statistic may make meek stand out.

* OTOH, you should also frame that meek doesn't have to conform with an
  *average* traffic profile, just with one that isn't *too* unusual.  The
  censor will incur serious collateral damage even if they block just
  the upper 1% of strong-traffic-to-Google.

* Related to this, you shouldn't just look at the distributions but
  also the associated *variance* across users.

* "model of normal traffic, which is an open problem" - that's quite a 
  strong statement.  Arguably a *complete* model is an open problem,
  but that's not what's needed here.  If you had more/longer traces,
  wouldn't that enable you to address this fairly well?

* I particularly like the observation that if this modeling is hard for
  you-the-meek-designer then it's also hard for the censor.

* What's meant by Tor Browser being "patched to defend against
  application-layer identity leaks"?

* It's Highly Cool that you already have some real users!  (And at
  a whopping cost of one-hundred-and-eleven US cents. :-)

* Tell us more about what's unclear in CloudFlare's ToS.

* "... or else blocking a large number of unrelated web sites".  It's
  valuable here to reflect on Pakistan's blocking of YouTube, which
  was meant to just prevent access to one video, but they lacked the
  technical means to do that, so they blocked the whole thing - clearly
  with collateral damage.  So it's not unprecedented.

* The discussion about PHP implementations etc. at the end of section 7
  is opaque.  (Seems PHP here is a red herring and you really just mean
  lots-of-App-Engine-services.)


Presentation:

* You make heavy use of passive voice.  You could make the writing much
  more lively by switching some of it to active voice.  This definitely
  slowed down my reading of parts of the writeup

* System names are generally capitalized, i.e., "Meek" not "meek".
  This particularly matters given that "meek" is an English word and thus
  when the eye scans it mid-sentence without capitalization, it can at
  first get absorbed as an adjective rather than the name of your system.
  If it really matters to you that it remain lowercase, then set it in
  a different font (such as via \textsf{}); though keep in mind that
  not capitalizing it will strike some readers as an author-centric
  flourish (i.e., you're not helping them out by following the usual
  convention of capitalizing).

* You used a 10pt font even though I asked for 11pt at
  http://www.icir.org/vern/cs261n/writing.html .  Note that for conference
  submission, if you don't follow the formatting requirements (particularly
  for an issue like this), your paper will likely be rejected unread.
  (It also makes me suspect you didn't take note of the other writing
  considerations on that page.)

* Likewise, you didn't submit your document source as asked.  Glitches
  like these put the reviewer in a grumpy mood :-(.

* What's up with citations like "[7, Section 3]"?  The point referred
  to here (in the Intro) is on page 6, not page 7.  And in any case,
  that's not the usual convention for section cross-references.

* Cross-reference glitch in the Intro: "Section 14.23"

* Is it really "flash proxy" and not "Flash proxy"?  (More lowercasing?)
  I found that visually distracting; it's reminiscent of "flash crowd".
  If that's the reference, rather than use of Flash, then explain that
  to the reader.

* Avoid use of "things", it's quite vague.

* Avoid use of contractions like "it's" or "doesn't".

x "Classic example ... early 2012" - something 2 years old is not "classic"!

* Capitalize "CAPTCHA".

* Some of your paragraphs are quite long.  This gets tiring for the reader.

* The HTTPS info in Figure 1 is too small to make out readily.

* "HTTP long polling" is not clear.

* Figure 2 should be bigger.  You could move it to an Appendix to
  facilitate this.

* The dashed lines in Figure 3 look solid in black-and-white.

* "We only interested in the Google traffic only" reads awkwardly.

* "This result [different packet size distributions] is unexpected ... but
  meek changes the packet size distribution".  The reader is confused at
  this point (why is it unexpected if you know that meek changes the
  distribution?).  You need to structure this more clearly to then lead
  into the next paragraph.

x Typo, contract -> contrast

* "how many HTTPS connections to Google did a user make" reads awkwardly.

* "most of the numbers concentrate on 1  10" - hyphen missing

* "typical pattern of using Google is ..." - add citation, or frame that
  *presumably* this is the case

* You should try Figure 5 log-scaled (X axis only) to see if it's
  more illuminating.  As it is, all of the action is in the leftmost
  part of the plot.

* Figure 6 is baffling in black-and-white.  Also, it says "Concurrent
  HTTPS connections over time" but doesn't state at what granularity.
  Per user?  For your sequential visiting of the Alexa sites?

* Figure 7 should be bigger (for the report); should merge the two halves;
  and should employ log-scaling so the two halves will both reasonably fit.

* The lines in Figure 8 are not particularly meaningful.  Stick with
  points/barplots.

* Avoid orphan subsections like 7.1 (i.e., there's no subsequent 7.2
  subsection).

* The bibliography is quite nicely put together.  The URLs are very
  handy, though for conference submission you would often omit them
  (or turn them into shortened URLs) to save space.
