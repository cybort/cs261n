CS261N Project Status Report

(1. Sketch the project)

(2. What completed)
- Implementation
    - Working Prototype
    - Browser Extensions (Firefox and Chrome)
- Evaluation
    - TLS Fingerprint
    - Traffic Analysis
        - SYN interval (normal)
        - Flow Duration (normal / meek)
        - Upstream/Downstream Ratio (normal / meek)
        - Packet Length (normal)

(3. What remains)
- Flow duration seems to be an issue.
- More attack scenarios:
    - Site fingerprint 
        The attacker may be able to fingerprint https://www.google.com/ according to some patterns (first few packet sizes for example). If the traffic that goes to Google does not exhibit these patterns, the censor will block the traffic.

(4. Open issues)
- Do we need to shape the traffic?

(5. Preference for presentation slot)
- The later the better?
